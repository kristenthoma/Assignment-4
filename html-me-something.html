                <h2 class="h2" id="bucky">Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier</h2>

                <p>James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes was a childhood best friend of Steve Rogers. He was drafted into the Army to serve as a sniper in the 107th Airborne Regiment during World War Two. His unit came under attack and Bucky was subsequently captured by Nazi science division Hydra, tortured and experimented on. Eventually he was rescued by his best friend Steve, now Captain America. After his rescue he served with Captain America in the Howling Commandos, dismantaling Hydra bases all over Europe. During one such mission to capture Hydra scientist Dr. Zola, Bucky fell from a moving train and was presumed KIA. Unbeknownst to anyone, the experiments Bucky underwent as a POW enabled him to survive the fall and he was once again taken captive by Hydra. They brainwashed him and put him under their control, turning him into an assasin known as the Winter Soldier.</p>

                <h2 id="wanda">Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch</h2>

                <p>Wanda Maximoff is a Chaos Magician originally from the country of Sokovia. She had a twin brother, Pietro aka Quiksilver who was killed during Ultron's attack against the Avengers in Sokovia. After her brother's death, Wanda joined the Avengers and developed a relationship with robotic synth Vision. During the events of Civil War, Wanda sided with Captain America and was ultimately imprisoned after the battle. Captain America broke her out of prison and she lived off the grid with Vision after reconciling. They came under attack by Thanos where Vision was wounded and were moved to Wakanda where she helped in the city's defense. Ultimately, the Avengers failed to defeat Thanos and Wanda was snapped out of existence. When she came back in Endgame, Vision was still dead. To deal with her grief over losing Vision, Wanda created an alternate reality in which she and Vision try to live happily ever after.</p>

                <h2 id="loki">Loki, God of Mischief</h2>

                <p>Loki, Prince of Asgard and God of Mischief is the adopted brother of Thor. Born as a Frost Giant in Jotunheim, Loki was found by King Odin and brought back to Asgard where he and Queen Frigga raised him in hopes of using him to bring peace to Asgard and the Frost Giants. When Loki found out about his heritage, he felt betrayed by his adoptive parents for lying to him and using him as a pawn to broker peace. Loki eventually rebels against his family and teams up with Thanos to take over Midgard aka Earth. This fails however, and Loki's timeline diverges into two from the point of his capture. One timeline goes on to reunite with Thor and die trying to save him by killing Thanos, while the other is captured by the TVA for crimes against the Sacred Timeline. </p>
